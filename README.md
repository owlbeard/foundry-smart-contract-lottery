# Provably Random Raffle Contract

## About

This code is to create a provably random smart contract lottery.

## What we want it to do?

1. Users can enter by paying lottery for a ticket
2. The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw
3. After x period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner
4. And this will be done programmatically
5. Using Chainlink VRF & Chainlink Automation
6. Chainlink VRF => Randomness
7. Chainlink Automation => Time based trigger
